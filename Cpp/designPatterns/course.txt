   ●  Difference between aggregation and composition.
      ▶  they are both associations.
      ▶  the relation between customer and bank 
         ◾  a bank can have 1 or more customers.
            so a customer is aggregated in the bank    

         ◾  if the life cycle of a cusomter stems from the life cycle of the
            bank then the customer is composite in the bank 
            the life of a customer would depend on the bank's if its
            intantiated on the bank's class 
            or if there is a pointer to the customer that is allocted and
            deleted by the bank.
