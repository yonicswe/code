to execute a service in this example 
i copied the file 'functions' from /etc/rc.d/init.d of my fedora 13 
and used the function daemon from it.

the run_forever script uses this function to run the script forever.sh 
which forever touches the file 'x'

after running 'run_forever' I can kill the shell and see how the process is still alive.
from another shell of course.


note. 
   the files were produces on /root so 
   to check how it runs 
   thats why the binary variable is set to /root/...
